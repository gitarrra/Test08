        <h1>Exceptional care leads to better results</h1>

        <p>Think about your health care needs when choosing a category of Marketplace plan.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>If you expect a lot of doctor visits or need regular prescriptions:</strong> You may want a Gold plan or Platinum plan. These plans generally have higher monthly premiums but pay more of your costs when you need care.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>If you don’t expect to use regular medical services and don’t take regular prescriptions:</strong> You may want a Silver, Bronze, or Catastrophic plan. These plans cost you less per month, but pay less of your costs when you need care.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>If you qualify to save on out-of-pocket costs:</strong> Silver plans may offer the best value. You may qualify for lower out-of-pocket costs based on your household size and income.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>If you do qualify, you can get these out-of-pocket savings only if you enroll in a Silver plan.</strong> If you make this choice you'll basically get the lower out-of-pocket costs of a Gold or Platinum plan while paying a Silver plan premium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>If you’re under 30 or have a hardship exemption and want low monthly premiums:</strong> You may want to choose a catastrophic plan designed to protect you from worst-case scenarios, like serious accidents or diseases.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
